# bos-v1
Bos v1 â€“ AI butler web app.

## Networking

The application performs outbound HTTP requests to several APIs. Some
environments set `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` variables that point to an
unreachable proxy, which prevents network access. The app now removes these
variables at startup so it can connect directly.
